    <h1>ECMAScript</h1>

    <p>
        ECMAScript (or ES) is the standardized scripting language specification that 
        JavaScript is based on. The rules for ECMAScript are outlined in the 
        ECMAScript Language Specification. Here are some of the main rules and 
        principles:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong> ECMAScript defines the syntax rules for writing JavaScript code, 
            including rules for identifiers, keywords, operators, and punctuation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Types:</strong> It defines various data types such as Boolean, Number, String, 
            Object, Array, Function, etc., and rules for how these types behave 
            and interact with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Expressions and Statements:</strong> ECMAScript specifies rules for writing
            expressions and statements, including rules for control structures like
            if statements, loops, switch statements, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Functions:</strong> It defines the syntax and behavior of functions, including
            function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, and the
            scope and context in which functions execute.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Objects and Prototypes:</strong> ECMAScript defines the rules for creating and 
            working with objects, including object literals, constructor functions, 
            prototypes, inheritance, and object-oriented programming concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Error Handling:</strong> It specifies rules for error handling, including the
            try-catch-finally mechanism for catching and handling exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Modules:</strong> ECMAScript defines rules for modular programming, including 
            the import and export syntax for defining dependencies between different 
            parts of a program.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Strict Mode:</strong> ECMAScript includes a strict mode that enforces stricter 
            rules for writing JavaScript code, helping to catch common programming 
            errors and improve code quality.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Host Environment Integration:</strong> It specifies rules for how ECMAScript 
            integrates with its host environment, such as web browsers or 
            server-side environments like Node.js.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Standard Library:</strong> ECMAScript defines a standard library of built-in
            objects and functions that are available in all ECMAScript environments, 
            providing common functionality like manipulating arrays, working with 
            dates, and performing mathematical operations.
        </li>
        <li>
            These are some of the main rules and principles outlined in the ECMAScript 
            specification, which help ensure consistency and interoperability across 
            different implementations of JavaScript.
        </li>
    </ul>
