                        A drone, also known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is an 
                        aircraft that is operated without a human pilot on board. Drones 
                        can be remotely controlled by a human operator or autonomously 
                        programmed to fly on predefined routes or perform specific tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Drones come in various shapes, sizes, and configurations, ranging from 
                        small quadcopters used for recreational purposes to large fixed-wing 
                        aircraft employed for military surveillance or cargo delivery. 
                        They can be equipped with a wide range of sensors, cameras, and other 
                        payloads to collect data, capture images or videos, conduct surveillance, 
                        monitor environmental conditions, or even deliver goods.
