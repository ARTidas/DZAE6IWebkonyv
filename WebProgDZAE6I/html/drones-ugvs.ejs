                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The concept of UGVs traces back to the mid-20th century, with early 
                            prototypes used primarily for experimental purposes. However, significant 
                            advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, and sensor technologies 
                            over the past few decades have propelled UGVs from rudimentary platforms 
                            to sophisticated, autonomous systems capable of performing complex missions.
